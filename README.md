# Color Palette

The global goal was to practice TypeScript in a React application, as well as creating a filtration for the list in a fun and creative manner, without using _flashy_ libraries and tools.

## I had a lot of fun doing it ðŸ˜Š

### As a user, you can:

- Search, add, and remove colors from the list.
- Sort the list by one or more available filters.

### App logic:

- The 10 default colors will remain unchanged.
- Any custom color will be saved within localStorage.
- Multiple tabs will synchronize colors with any updates to localStorage.
