# Color Palette

The global goal was to practice TypeScript in React application.
As well as creating filtration for list in fun and creative manner, without using **flashy** libraries and tools.

## I've got a lot of fun doing it, learn a lot and will keep going!

### As user you can:

- search, add and remove colors to the list;
- sort list by one or more available filters;

### Behavior of app:

- 10 default colors will stay unchangeble;
- any custom color will be saved within localStorage;
- multiple tabs will synchronize colors with any update of localStorage;
